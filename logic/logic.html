First it is a nice simulation exercise. Second it shows off object oriented programming
well, especially the power of inheritance. Finally real logic circuits built
with electronic components are the basis for computer hardware. The simplest are
gates (AND, OR, NOT) made with only a few transistors and resisters. Since the mid
1960's these circuits have been fabricated in integrated circuits (chips). Before that
they were built with seperate transistors and resisters wired together on circuit
boards. Today you can purchase chips with, say, six NOT gates or four 2 input NAND
gates (an AND gate followed by a NOT) for as little as a quarter at your local electronics
retailer.</p><p>We will use a couple of Python classes to simulate the behavior of logic circuits. We
will have a base class LC (logic circuit) which will be subclassed to actual gates and
other circuits. A second class, Connector, will be used to provide inputs and outputs
to the logic circuits. An output connectors <em> connect</em> method will simulate the
wiring of LC's to one another.</p><p><a href="logic.py">Click Here for Full Python Source</a></p><p>We will start with 3 simple LC's and proceed to build everything else from them. When we are
done with this part we will have a LC that adds two binary numbers together. In the
next part we will see how the same simple LC's can be used to provide computer memory
and even multiplication of binary numbers.</p><p>Our 3 basic LC's are the two input AND and OR gates and the NOT gate (sometimes called
an inverter).</p><p>The AND gate has two inputs (generally labeled A and B) and and output C. The inputs and
output may have the value 0 or 1. The output C is 1 if and only if both A and B are 1.
Otherwise it is 0. (see fig. 1)</p><p><img src="fig1.GIF" /></p><p>The OR gate is very similar with the same inputs A and B, and output C. The output C
is 1 if either A or B is 1, Otherwise it is 0.</p><p>The NOT gate has a single input A and output B. The output is the opposite of the input. If
the input is 0, the output is 1. If the input is 1, the output is 0.</p><p>From these basic 3 LC's (or gates), everything else is built by using existing LC's and
connecting outputs to inputs in certain ways. For example to make a NAND gate where
the output C is 0 if and only if both inputs are 1, we can use and AND gate followed
by a NOT gate. The inputs of the AND gate are the inputs to the NAND. The AND output
is connected to the NOT input. The NOT output is the output for the NAND. See figure 2.</p><p><img src="fig2.GIF" /></p><p>A more interesting LC (see figure 3) is the XOR gate. It is built with 2 NOT's, 2
AND's and an OR gate. Its output C is 1 if the inputs A and B are not the same. We
can see how this works looking at the figure. The LC output is the OR gate output
and will be 1 if either of
the AND gate outputs are 1. The top AND gate output is 1 if input A is 1 and B is 0.
The lower AND gate output is 1 if A is 0 and B is 1. If A and B are the same, both
AND gate outputs are 0. You should convince yourself of this in more detail.</p><p><img src="fig3.GIF" /></p><p>Lets look at our Python classes now. The class Connector will provide inputs and
outputs for instances of the LC class (and subclasses). Each Connector will belong
to an owner and have a name. By convention the name is a string that reflects the
variable name we choose for the connector. This will let us monitor outputs during
execution. Every connector has a current value, either 0 or 1. This will change as
the program executes.</p><p>An output connector will normally be connected to one or more input connectors unless
it is a final output, in which case it will probably be monitored. Input connectors
will have their &quot;activates&quot; attribute true, so that when their value is changed they
wake up their owner (an LC) to reevaluate its output(s).</p><p>So this is the code to initialize a Connector instance</p><pre class="python">

the AND gate. See figure 2. Then we'll change one the inputs.</p><pre class="python-interpreter">

of an Xor is built, we grab 2 AND gates, 2 Inverters, and an OR gate and wire them
up as shown in the figure. Notice in particular how we connect the external input (self.A)
to an input of an internal gate (self.A1.A)</p><pre class="python">

</pre><p>Now, finally, we are ready to talk about addition. So let's start with something familiar.
Suppose we want to add 168 and 234. Hmm. 8 plus 4 is 2 and carry 1. 1 plus 6 plus 3 is
0 and carry a 1. Finally 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4. Answer 402.</p><p>So when we were all 7 years old we memorized 100 (10 times 10) rules
of addition like 8+4=12 (or 2 and carry 1). Of course if you get tricky and remember that
8+4 is the same as 4+8 and that zero plus anything is just that anything, you can
reduce the amount of memorization to 45 items.</p><p>In binary it is so much simpler. 4 rules (2 times 2) instead of 100. If you are tricky,
just 1. Basically that 1+1=2 (well 10, that is 0 and carry 1). Now to represent a number
in binary requires about 3.5 times as many digits as decimal but you can start to see that
this may be a good tradeoff.</p><p>Actually so far we're just talking about the first (rightmost) column. There is no carry
in yet. But bear with me for a moment. Lets summarize the 4 rules of binary addition</p><pre class="shell">
   0 + 0 = 0
   0 + 1 = 1
   1 + 0 = 1
   1 + 1 = 0  and carry a 1
</pre><p>We will build a half adder circuit with 2 inputs and 2 outputs. See figure 4. The Sum output
is the same as the XOR gate above. That is the sum bit is one if one and only one of the
input bits is 1. The carry out is 1 only if both inputs are 1. For that we need an AND
gate.</p><p><img src="fig4.GIF" /></p><pre class="python">

</pre><p>and we are working on the middle column. We'll have a carry in of 1 (9+3=2, carry the 1) plus

carry in 1 to the 2 to get 3 for sum digit. In the 2 additions, at most only one will
generate a carry. You might want to play with some examples to convince yourself of this.</p><p>Look at figure 5. We add A and B and take the sum bit and add it to the carry in bit. Only
